Description project: This program allows you to claster points in two-dimensional space using the [k-means method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering).
Data (coordinates of points) are taken from the specified files in the datasets folder. 
The user can set the number of clusters by himself. The centers of clusters are set randomly. 
Besides, it is possible to cluster all the points with recalculation of centers step by step.
